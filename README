c3po is a JavaScript utility to handle all 3rd party widgets.

Build by combining `c3po.js` and any desired 3rd party providers from `providers/` into your app code.

In your pages, put the widget tags as usual:

  `<div class="fb-like" data-href="http://phpied.com"></div>`

Whenever you're ready, call:

  `c3po.parse()`
